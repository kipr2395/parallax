                <p>On July 7, 1995, Selene was a waxing gibbous moon, and at 12:00 am she was visible in the sky over San Francisco.</p>
                <p>She was waiting to see something special today, but she realized it was going to take a while. She decided it would be better to come back later in the day, so she set at 1:37 am and decided to go see some of her other favorite places.</p>
