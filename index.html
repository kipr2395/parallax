        <p>On July 7, 1995, Selene was a waxing gibbous moon, and at 12:00 am she was visible in the sky over San Francisco.</p>
        <p>She was waiting to see something special today, but she realized it was going to take a while. She decided it would be better to come back later in the day, so she set at 1:37 am and decided to go see some of her other favorite places.</p>

    <section id="group2" class="group">
        <div class="parallaxLayer base"></div>
        <p>By the time she got to Tokyo, Japan, it was already 1:17 pm. She hungout with the Ra, the sun, and they gushed over the delicious sushi people were eating below. </p>

    <section id="group3" class="group">
        <div class="parallaxLayer base"></div>
       <p>Next, she decided she wanted to see what everyone was doing in Egypt. She had already been earlier in the day, but she joined Ra there at 2:42 pm because she just loved seeing the Great Pyramids of Giza and the Great Sphinx.</p>

       <p>Ran moved on to the next place before Selene, but next she met him in Santorini, Greece at 3:16 pm. They watched everyone lounging on the beaches under Ra's bright rays, and they also checked out the Acropolis of Athens while they were over Greece.</p>

    <section id="group4" class="group">
        <div class="parallaxLayer base"></div>
       <p>It was 3:37 pm when she got back to Paris, France, and she watched people having picnics in front of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
       <p>When she got to London, England, Big Ben told her it was 3:34 pm there, which meant it was 4:34 pm in Paris and 7:30 am back in San Francisco.</p>
    </section>    
    <section id="group5" class="group">
        <div class="parallaxLayer base"></div>
       <p>She was getting worried she was going to miss the big event in San Francisco, so she made her way back to the US. It was 3:19 pm when she got to New York City, and she stayed and watched all the fascinating people walking around the city that never sleeps.</p>

    <section id="group6" class="group">
        <div class="parallaxLayer base"></div>
       <p>By the time she got back to San Francisco, it was 3:19 pm PST, and Ra decided he would wait around with her to see what she was so excited about.</p>
        <p>Finall, after a long day of waiting, Selene finally got to see what she had been waiting for.</p>
    </section> 
    <section id="group7" class="group">
        <div class="parallaxLayer base"></div>
       <p>Preciselly at 7:10 pm, Selene and Ra both welcomed a new baby into the world. They both watched as she took her first breath, and they both squealed with excitement as her mother held her for the first time.</p>
